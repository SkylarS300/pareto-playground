# Pareto Playground

An interactive tool for exploring multi-objective optimization problems and visualizing tradeoffs between competing objectives.

Instead of producing a single “optimal” answer, this project uses Pareto optimality and shows how different solutions dominate or coexist depending on chosen values and constraints.

## Motivation
Many real-world decisions involve conflicting goals such as efficiency vs cost, performance vs fatigue, etc. This project gets into how those tradeoffs emerge mathmatically and visually.

## Features (in progress)
- Multi-objective scoring
- Pareto front computation
- Interactive weight sliders
- Real-time tradeoff visualization
- Domain-specific scenarios

## Math Focus
- Pareto dominance
- Linear weighting methods
- Discrete solution space sampling
- Tradeoff analysis (not analytic optimization)

## Status
Early development. Core modeling engine in progress.
